Arsenal vs Real Madrid – April 8, 2025 – Match Report

Arsenal delivered a dominant performance against Real Madrid with a 3-0 victory in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League quarter-final at the Emirates Stadium. The match, held on April 8, 2025, saw Arsenal outplay the Spanish giants with clinical finishing, solid defense, and a standout display from midfielder Declan Rice.

Arsenal opened the scoring in the second half through Declan Rice, who netted a superb free-kick from the edge of the box. His technique and placement left the goalkeeper with no chance. Rice followed up with another brilliant set-piece goal just minutes later, doubling Arsenal’s lead and sending the home crowd into a frenzy.

The third goal came from Mikel Merino, who capitalized on a defensive error by Real Madrid to slot the ball into the net and seal a convincing win for the Gunners. Arsenal looked in control throughout the match, dictating the tempo and creating multiple chances. They ended the game with eleven shots on target, compared to Real Madrid’s three.

Real Madrid struggled to cope with Arsenal’s pressing and intensity. Their midfield was overrun, and they found it difficult to break down Arsenal’s backline. Key players were kept quiet for much of the match, and the lack of attacking output will be a concern heading into the second leg.

The win gives Arsenal a significant advantage going into the return leg in Madrid. A three-goal cushion means that Real Madrid will need an extraordinary performance at home to overturn the deficit and progress to the semi-finals.

This result marks one of Arsenal’s most impressive performances in recent European competition. Declan Rice’s display, in particular, was a standout, showcasing his leadership, technical ability, and composure under pressure. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta praised the team’s focus and discipline, calling it a “complete performance.”

With the second leg looming, Arsenal will aim to maintain their momentum, while Real Madrid face the challenge of regrouping and responding at the Santiago Bernabéu. The tie is far from over, but Arsenal have taken a big step toward a potential semi-final appearance.
